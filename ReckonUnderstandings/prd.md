# Full PRD for RAG Chatbot for ReckonSales ERP Platform

## Product Requirements Document: RAG Chatbot for ReckonSales

### Overview

We will build an AI-powered, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot for ReckonSales. The bot combines a retrieval engine (searching Reckon's knowledge base and systems) with a large language model to produce accurate, context-aware answers. By grounding responses in company data (documentation, CRM/ERP records, FAQs, etc.), the bot avoids "hallucinations" and delivers precise answers (e.g. real-time order status or inventory levels). It will operate 24/7 for up to 50,000 users per day, reducing wait times and human workload. The result is instant, reliable support and sales assistance at any time.

### Goals & Objectives

- **24/7 Accurate Support**: Provide instant, fact-based answers around the clock using Reckon-specific data.
- **System Integration**: Deeply integrate with Reckon's CRM, ERP, and ticketing systems so chat actions update customer records, tickets, and tasks automatically.
- **Omnichannel Availability**: Offer a unified experience on web, mobile and messaging (e.g. WhatsApp) with seamless context transfer.
- **Multilingual Capability**: Support English and Hindi (with room to add languages), auto-detecting or switching per user preference.
- **High Scalability & Reliability**: Handl

e ~50k daily users with cloud auto-scaling and 99.9%+ uptime.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Use analytics to refine the bot over time, improving coverage and accuracy of answers.

## Key Features and Capabilities

### Enterprise Integration

Connect to Reckon's CRM, helpdesk and ERP. The bot will log every chat into the user's CRM record and can auto-create support tickets or tasks. For example, if a user reports an issue, the bot logs it and opens a ticket in real time. It can also schedule events (e.g. demo calls) directly in the CRM calendar. Through the ERP integration, the bot fetches live data (such as inventory levels or billing details) to answer user queries accurately. This makes the chatbot part of Reckon's workflows rather than a silo.

### Omnichannel Deployment

Deploy the same chatbot across Reckon's website, mobile app and messaging channels (e.g. WhatsApp Business). The bot will preserve conversation history across channels, so a user can start on one channel and continue on another without losing context. This ensures consistent support no matter how the user reaches out.

### Multilingual Support

The chatbot will handle English and Hindi by default. It will auto-detect the user's language or let them switch, providing responses in the chosen language. (Platforms like Denser.ai support 80+ languages, e.g. "Denser's chatbot can communicate in over 80 languages".) For ReckonSales, Hindi support will help serve regional customers effectively.

### Advanced Natural Language Understanding

Implement state-of-the-art NLP so the bot truly understands user intent beyond keywords. It will parse industry-specific jargon and conversational nuances. The session context will be tracked so that follow-up questions remain coherent. For example, if a user asks "How do I reconcile ledger entries?" and then "And how about for multiple branches?", the bot remembers the topic and answers in context. Robust NLP and intent recognition enable this natural, multi-turn dialogue.

### Personalization

Leverage CRM/user data to tailor each interaction. The bot will recognize returning customers and use their profile (name, company, subscription modules) in replies. For instance, it can greet a known client by name or suggest features based on their subscription. By pulling purchase or ticket history from CRM, the bot can answer with relevant details (e.g. "Yes, your last purchase of Item X was on July 5th"). This personal touch makes responses more helpful and user-friendly.

### Proactive Assistance

Go beyond reactive Q&A by triggering helpful interventions. For example, if the bot detects that a bill due date is approaching, it can proactively send a reminder. If a user lingers on the pricing page, the bot can prompt "Can I help you with pricing options?" Using an event-driven approach, the bot listens for triggers (like overdue invoices or new feature releases) and messages users before they ask. This proactive behavior anticipates user needs and improves engagement.

### Conversational Memory (Multi-turn Dialog)

The chatbot will maintain context over the entire conversation (and optionally across past sessions). It remembers earlier messages so users aren't forced to repeat themselves. For example, after a user identifies their ReckonSales product, the bot retains that choice for subsequent questions. The RAG system itself helps by tracking retrieved documents and prior turns to avoid irrelevant repetition. Effective dialogue management ensures interactions feel fluid and natural even over many back-and-forth exchanges.

### Smooth Escalation to Humans

When the bot is unsure or the user requests, it will hand off the conversation to a human agent. Integration with CRM ensures the agent sees the full chat transcript and user details. In practice, the bot will offer an option like "Let me connect you with support" and then log the handoff. According to Denser.ai, integrated chatbots "allow smooth handoffs to human reps when needed". This ensures complex issues are resolved by humans while routine queries stay automated, improving overall support quality.

### Analytics & Continuous Improvement

Build dashboards to track KPIs: chat volume, response time, resolution rate, user satisfaction, common topics, etc. Monitoring these metrics is critical for iterative improvement. For example, tracking which questions fail helps us enrich the knowledge base and retrain the model. The system will log conversation data (with privacy safeguards) to refine answer accuracy over time. Regular analysis and model fine-tuning close the feedback loop.

### Security & Compliance

Enforce enterprise-grade security at every layer. The chatbot will require user authentication (e.g. via Reckon's SSO) before accessing any account-specific data. All communications use encryption. Sensitive data (financial, personal) is only shown to authenticated users. The design follows standards like GDPR (and HIPAA if applicable for healthcare clients). We will audit and log all sensitive transactions to maintain an audit trail.

### Scalability & Reliability

Architect the backend for high concurrency. We will deploy on a cloud platform with auto-scaling containers or serverless functions so thousands of users can chat simultaneously with minimal latency. Techniques like caching frequent queries and using a vector-search database will speed retrieval. The design targets 99.9% uptime. Redundant servers, load balancing, and monitoring ensure performance under peak load (~50k daily users). If the AI service reaches capacity, we'll have graceful fallbacks (e.g. simple FAQ mode).

## User Stories

- **As a pharmacy owner**, I can ask the chatbot how to perform a billing procedure, and it replies with a step-by-step answer drawn from Reckon's documentation.
- **As a sales rep**, I can provide a customer's email or order number, and the bot automatically updates the CRM contact or retrieves that order's status from the ERP.
- **As a mobile user**, I can switch between website chat and WhatsApp, and the bot continues the same conversation without losing context.
- **As a Hindi-speaking user**, I can ask my questions in Hindi and receive answers in Hindi without repeating myself in English.
- **As a user needing help**, if the bot can't answer, it escalates me to a human agent seamlessly, so the support team sees the entire chat history.

## Non-Goals (MVP Scope)

- **No voice or video support**: This MVP is text-chat only (no voice assistants, phone calls, or video conferencing).
- **No offline channels**: We will not handle email or SMS support; focus is on live chat channels.
- **Limited language support**: Beyond English/Hindi, no additional languages are initially supported.
- **No advanced avatar or VR**: We won't implement any avatars or virtual/augmented reality features.
- **No external integrations beyond scope**: We won't integrate with third-party social media beyond WhatsApp Business.
- **Simplified user management**: We assume users are already registered/logged in; the bot won't handle user sign-up or complex authentication flows beyond verifying identity.

## Success Metrics

- **Availability**: 99.9% uptime and 24/7 readiness.
- **Response Performance**: Fast replies (e.g. <2 seconds average response time).
- **Resolution Rate**: High first-contact resolution (target ≥80% of queries answered by the bot without escalation).
- **User Satisfaction**: Strong satisfaction scores (e.g. user rating ≥4/5) and reduced support wait times.
- **User Engagement**: Support ~50,000 chats/day with graceful scaling.
- **Integration Impact**: Key workflows automated (e.g. ≥90% of detected issues correctly logged as support tickets).

## Technical Requirements

### LLM & RAG Engine

Use a proven LLM (e.g. GPT-4 via API) coupled with a vector database (e.g. Pinecone, Milvus) containing Reckon's manuals, FAQs, and data. The RAG pipeline will retrieve relevant text chunks and feed them to the LLM for answer generation.

### API Integrations

Build connectors to ReckonSales's CRM (e.g. Salesforce or HubSpot) and ERP. These APIs allow the bot to read/write data (orders, contacts, tickets). Secure API keys and OAuth flows will be used.

### Authentication

Require single sign-on (SSO) so that the bot can identify the user and fetch account-specific info. Use JWT or OAuth tokens to authorize data access.

### User Interface

Develop chat UIs for web and mobile (e.g. a React/Next.js widget and a Flutter/React Native mobile interface). Integrate with WhatsApp Business API for messaging. UI will support message streaming and context history.

### Cloud Infrastructure

Host on a cloud platform (AWS, Azure, or GCP) with container orchestration (Kubernetes or similar). Use auto-scaling groups and load balancers to handle variable load. Caching (e.g. Redis) for frequent queries.

### Data Security & Compliance

Encrypt all data in transit and at rest. Implement audit logging for sensitive actions. Ensure the system design meets GDPR/HIPAA requirements for data handling.

### Monitoring & Analytics

Integrate logging (e.g. ELK stack) and monitoring tools (e.g. Prometheus/Grafana) to track system health and user interactions.

## Future Roadmap (Post-MVP)

### Late Month 1

Complete core RAG engine, ingest Reckon docs into vector DB, launch basic chat UI, and set up CRM ticket logging. Begin internal testing of core Q&A flows.

### Early Month 2

Add multilingual support (Hindi via translation API or multilingual model). Enable additional channels (WhatsApp, mobile app). Integrate with the ERP API to fetch real-time inventory/billing data.

### Mid Month 2

Refine NLP (improve intent models, handle more query types), expand knowledge base with user feedback. Implement proactive triggers (bill reminders). Deploy analytics dashboards and finalize security tests (SSO, permission checks).

### Ongoing

Run weekly sprints with user testing and demos. After launch, iterate by analyzing logs, expanding languages, and possibly adding new AI features (e.g. voice interface, advanced analytics).

## Risks & Mitigations

### Data Privacy Risk

**Risk**: Exposing sensitive data.  
**Mitigation**: Enforce strong authentication (SSO), encrypt all communications, and strictly limit data access to authenticated users. Comply with GDPR/HIPAA guidelines.

### Model Hallucination

**Risk**: The LLM might generate incorrect answers.  
**Mitigation**: Use RAG grounding (supply retrieved facts in prompts) to keep answers factual. Also provide clear "I'm not sure" fallback and escalate when confidence is low.

### Scalability

**Risk**: High load could slow responses.  
**Mitigation**: Employ auto-scaling and caching. Design with cloud-native patterns and monitor usage to add resources preemptively. Zoho recommends 99.9%+ uptime for chatbots.

### NLP Misunderstanding

**Risk**: The bot may misinterpret queries or context.  
**Mitigation**: Continuously refine intent models with real chat data. Provide quick options or clarification prompts when intent confidence is low.

### Integration Complexity

**Risk**: Delays connecting to legacy systems.  
**Mitigation**: Use standard APIs and begin integration early. Provide a simple mock interface if needed during development.
